To achieve this, you can set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the process of fetching notes from your Obsidian repository, building a React project, and deploying the web pages. Here's a general guide to help you get started:

1. **Set Up Your React Project:**
   - Create a new React project using `create-react-app` or any other method you prefer.
   - Write your React components to render the notes.

2. **Connect to Obsidian Git Repository:**
   - Ensure that you have the Obsidian Git plugin configured to sync your notes with a GitHub repository.

3. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - In your React project, create a new folder named `.github/workflows`.
   - Inside this folder, create a YAML file (e.g., `build-and-deploy.yml`) to define your GitHub Actions workflow.

   ```yaml
   name: Build and Deploy

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main  # Change this to the branch you want to trigger the workflow

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout Repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set Up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: 14

         - name: Install Dependencies
           run: npm install

         - name: Build React App
           run: npm run build

     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       needs: build
       
       steps:
         - name: Checkout Repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
           uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3
           with:
             ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             BRANCH: gh-pages  # Change this to the branch you want to deploy to
             FOLDER: build      # Change this to the build folder of your React app
   ```

4. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Ensure that your GitHub repository settings are configured to use GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch (or any branch you specified in the workflow).

5. **GitHub Secrets:**
   - Add the necessary secrets to your GitHub repository for any sensitive information, such as API keys or access tokens. In this example, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub.

6. **Push Changes:**
   - Commit your React project changes and push them to the repository.

Now, whenever you push changes to your main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will trigger. It will build your React app and deploy it to GitHub Pages. Make sure to adjust the paths and branch names according to your project structure and preferences.
