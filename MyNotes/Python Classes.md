Certainly! Here's a list of some common dunder methods and their purposes:

1. `__init__(self, ...)`: Initializes new objects. It's called when the object is created.

2. `__repr__(self)`: Returns a string representation of the object for debugging and logging. It should ideally be unambiguous and informative.

3. `__str__(self)`: Returns a string representation of the object for end-users. It's called by the `str()` function.

4. `__len__(self)`: Returns the length of the object when called by the `len()` function.

5. `__getitem__(self, key)`: Enables indexing and slicing operations for objects.

6. `__setitem__(self, key, value)`: Enables assignment to indexed values.

7. `__delitem__(self, key)`: Enables deletion of indexed values.

8. `__iter__(self)`: Returns an iterator object. It's called by the `iter()` function.

9. `__next__(self)`: Returns the next item from the iterator. It's called by the `next()` function.

10. `__contains__(self, item)`: Allows the use of the `in` operator to check for membership.

11. `__add__(self, other)`, `__sub__(self, other)`, `__mul__(self, other)`, etc.: Implement arithmetic operations.

12. `__eq__(self, other)`, `__lt__(self, other)`, `__gt__(self, other)`, etc.: Implement comparison operations.

13. `__enter__(self)`, `__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`: Implement context management protocol for objects used with the `with` statement.

14. `__call__(self, ...)`: Makes objects callable like functions.

15. `__getattr__(self, name)`: Called when an attribute lookup fails.

16. `__setattr__(self, name, value)`: Called when an attribute is set.

17. `__delattr__(self, name)`: Called when an attribute is deleted.

18. `__hash__(self)`: Returns a hash value for the object. It's used in hash-based collections like dictionaries and sets.

19. `__enter__(self)`, `__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`: Implement context management protocol for objects used with the `with` statement.

20. `__format__(self, format_spec)`: Returns a formatted representation of the object. It's called by the `format()` function and string formatting.

These are some of the most commonly used dunder methods, but there are others as well depending on specific use cases and Python versions.
