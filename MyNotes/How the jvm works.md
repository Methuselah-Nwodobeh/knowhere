## Difference b/n compiled and interpreted languages:
- For compiled langs, code is compiled first into platform specific machine code befor execution
	- Just in time compilation
	- Ahead of time compilation
- Interpreted langs execute instructions directly without having to compile them. They are platform independent.

## Java:
Java code is first compiled into bytecode to generate a class file. This file is then interpreted by the JVM for the underlying platform.
