The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows a method's behavior to be selected at runtime.

### Components of the Strategy Pattern:

1. **Strategy Interface/Abstract Class:** This defines an interface or an abstract class that represents a strategy or algorithm. It typically declares one or more methods that define the algorithm's contract.

2. **Concrete Strategies:** These are the concrete implementations of the strategy interface. Each concrete strategy implements the algorithm defined by the strategy interface.

3. **Context:** This is the class that uses the strategy. It has a reference to a strategy object and may define an interface that lets the strategy access its data.

### Example:

Let's consider a sorting application where we have different sorting algorithms (strategies) such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. We can use the Strategy Pattern to encapsulate each sorting algorithm and make them interchangeable.

```java
// Step 1: Define the Strategy Interface
interface SortingStrategy {
    void sort(int[] array);
}

// Step 2: Implement Concrete Strategies
class BubbleSort implements SortingStrategy {
    public void sort(int[] array) {
        // Implement Bubble Sort algorithm
    }
}

class QuickSort implements SortingStrategy {
    public void sort(int[] array) {
        // Implement Quick Sort algorithm
    }
}

class MergeSort implements SortingStrategy {
    public void sort(int[] array) {
        // Implement Merge Sort algorithm
    }
}

// Step 3: Create Context Class
class SortContext {
    private SortingStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(SortingStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void executeStrategy(int[] array) {
        strategy.sort(array);
    }
}

// Step 4: Usage Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5};
        
        // Create Context
        SortContext context = new SortContext();

        // Use Bubble Sort
        context.setStrategy(new BubbleSort());
        context.executeStrategy(array);

        // Use Quick Sort
        context.setStrategy(new QuickSort());
        context.executeStrategy(array);

        // Use Merge Sort
        context.setStrategy(new MergeSort());
        context.executeStrategy(array);
    }
}
```

### Benefits of the Strategy Pattern:

- Encapsulates algorithms: Each algorithm is encapsulated into its own class, making the code more modular and maintainable.
- Improves flexibility: Strategies can be changed at runtime or replaced without affecting the client code.
- Promotes code reuse: Strategies can be reused in different contexts.
- Promotes single responsibility principle: Each strategy class has a single responsibility - implementing a specific algorithm.

The Strategy Pattern is useful when you have multiple algorithms that can be used interchangeably or when you need to isolate the algorithm implementation details from the client code.
