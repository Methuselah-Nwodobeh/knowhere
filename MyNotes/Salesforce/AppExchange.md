Follow these steps to develop a good AppExchange strategy.

1. Identify departments that use or plan to use Salesforce. These are your primary stakeholders.
2. Research what’s available on AppExchange that best meets your stakeholder requirements. Discuss business cases with department heads to determine exact needs. Here are some good questions to ask:
    1. What business problem are you trying to solve?
    2. What are your main pain points right now?
    3. How many users need this app?
    4. What’s your budget?
    5. What’s your timeline?These questions help you identify apps that are the best fit for each department or business case.
3. When you find an app that you think meets your needs, download the app in a test environment (like a free Developer Edition or sandbox). Ensure that the app you’re installing doesn’t interfere with any other apps you’ve installed or customization you’ve made. Sandboxes are copies of your organization in a separate environment. They’re used for development and testing. See [Sandbox Overview](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=create_test_instance.htm&language=en_US).
4. If you’re choosing between multiple apps, take some time to evaluate what you’ve tested. Determine whether there are feature gaps or unwanted functionality. If necessary, invite your stakeholders to demo the apps and provide feedback.
5. You’re ready to go! You’ll install and deploy your app in your production environment. Make sure you keep your users in the loop about what’s changing, and provide training and documentation as necessary.
