## Definition:
Salesforce is a CRM. It helps companies manage customer data more efficiently. Take Adidas, when Kofi sees an add from Adidas in his inbox, and he buys a shoe from the Adidas website due to this, Salesforce allows Adidas to see these events that led to this sale. Any problems Kofi encountered during it and while waiting for the arrival of his shoes, are tracked so they can be seen. This helps improve the customer experience.
