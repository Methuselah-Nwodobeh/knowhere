## Definition:
It's just database entities given a fancy name ðŸ™„

## Types of Objects:
- Standard objects

1. **Standard Objects:** Basic objects that come with each instance of Salesforce. E.g.: Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity.
2. **Custom objects:** Objects that are created by an admin or other Salesforce roles. They store information specific to your company.
If it were a django database, then django_session and django_migrations are standard objects and user, products, etc that a Django developer would create are custom objects.
