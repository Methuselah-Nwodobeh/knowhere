## Aim:
**To build a React project that takes notes from Obsidian (stored on GitHub using the Obsidian Git plugin) and renders them as webpages,**

### Project Outline:

1. **Setup:**
   - Set up a new React project using create-react-app.
   - Initialize a Git repository for version control.

2. **GitHub Integration:**
   - Connect your React project to GitHub.
   - Create a new repository for your React project on GitHub.

3. **Fetch Notes from GitHub:**
   - Implement the functionality to fetch notes from your Obsidian Git repository using the Obsidian Git plugin.

4. **Render Notes in React:**
   - Create React components to render the fetched notes as webpages.
   - Use a Markdown parser library for converting Markdown content to HTML.

5. **Routing:**
   - Implement React Router to create routes for each note.

6. **Kanban Board Integration:**
   - Choose a Kanban board tool (e.g., Trello, GitHub Projects).
   - Create a new board for your React project to manage tasks.

7. **Components and Styling:**
   - Develop React components for the Kanban board.
   - Apply styling to ensure a user-friendly interface.

8. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:**
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between different stages on the Kanban board.

9. **Status Updates:**
   - Create functionality to update the status of tasks on the Kanban board (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

10. **Testing:**
    - Write tests for your React components and any logic you've implemented.

11. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your React app to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
