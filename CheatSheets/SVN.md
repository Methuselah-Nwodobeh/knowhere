Subversion, often abbreviated as SVN, is a version control system that allows you to manage and track changes in your project's files and directories over time. It's commonly used for software development, but it can be applied to any project where you need to keep a history of changes and collaborate with others. Here's a basic guide to using Subversion, along with a Markdown cheatsheet:

## Subversion (SVN) Cheatsheet

### Setting Up SVN

1. **Install SVN:**
   You need to have Subversion installed on your system. You can download it from the [official website](https://subversion.apache.org/).

2. **Create a Repository:**
   Create a new repository to store your project's files and version history.
   ```shell
   svnadmin create /path/to/repository
   ```

3. **Import Your Project:**
   Import your project files into the SVN repository.
   ```shell
   svn import /path/to/project file:///path/to/repository/project -m "Initial import"
   ```

### Basic SVN Commands

- **Clone or Switch to a Repository:**
  ```shell
  svn checkout file:///path/to/repository/project
  ```

- **Pull latest changes from server:**
  To get the latest changes from the repository.
  ```shell
  svn update
  ```

- **Add a New File:**
  ```shell
  svn add filename
  ```

- **Commit Changes:**
  ```shell
  svn commit -m "Commit message"
  ```

- **View Status:**
  To see the status of your files (e.g., M for modified, A for added, D for deleted).
  ```shell
  svn status
  ```

- **Revert Changes:**
  To discard local changes.
  ```shell
  svn revert filename
  ```

- **View Log History:**
  To see the commit history.
  ```shell
  svn log
  ```

- **Differences Between Revisions:**
  To see the differences between revisions.
  ```shell
  svn diff -r <revision_number>
  ```

- **Branching and Merging:**
  Create branches for parallel development and merge changes between them.
  - Create a branch:
    ```shell
    svn copy /path/to/trunk /path/to/branch -m "Create branch"
    ```
  - Merge changes from a branch to the trunk:
    ```shell
    svn merge /path/to/branch
    ```

- **Resolve Conflicts:**
  When conflicts occur during merging, resolve them manually and use:
  ```shell
  svn resolve filename
  ```

- **Export a Clean Copy:**
  To export a clean copy of your project without the .svn metadata.
  ```shell
  svn export /path/to/repository/project /path/to/exported/project
  ```
