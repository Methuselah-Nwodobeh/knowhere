# Definition


# Finite Automata (Deterministic Finite Automata)
## Definition:
Is a 5-tuple (Q, ∑, d, q0, F)
Q = finite set of states
∑ = finite set of alphabet symbols used in the machine
d = transition function d: Q X ∑ -> Q
q0 = start state
F = - set of accept states

## Strings and Languages
- A string is a finite sequence of symbols in ∑
- A language is a set of strings (finite or infinite)
- The empty string ɛ is a string of length 0
- The empty language Ø is the set with no strings
- A language is a regular language if some automaton recognizes it.
