## What is Apache Spark?

**Apache Spark** is a unified computing engine and a set of libraries designed for parallel data processing on computer clusters. It’s the most actively developed open-source engine for handling big data tasks. 
**KeyPoints**:
- **Unified Nature**: Spark supports multiple widely used programming languages (Python, Java, Scala, and R) and includes libraries for diverse tasks, from SQL to streaming and machine learning.
- **Scalability**: It runs anywhere, from a laptop to a cluster of thousands of servers, making it easy to start with and scale up to big data processing.
- **Big Data Challenges**: Spark tackles the challenges associated with big data: high volume, high velocity, and high variety of information assets.

3. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn Spark’s APIs and concepts.
4. **Resource Management**: Proper cluster management is essential for optimal performance.
5. **Integration Challenges**: Migrating existing Hadoop workflows to Spark may require adjustments.

## Differences Between Spark and Hadoop:

1. **Processing Model**:
    
    - **Spark**: In-memory processing with DAG-based execution.
    - **Hadoop MapReduce**: Disk-based processing with a two-step Map-Reduce model.
2. **Ease of Use**:
    
    - **Spark**: Unified APIs and interactive shell.
    - **Hadoop MapReduce**: Requires writing custom Map and Reduce functions.
3. **Performance**:
    
    - **Spark**: Faster due to in-memory processing.
    - **Hadoop MapReduce**: Slower due to disk I/O.
4. **Use Cases**:
    
    - **Spark**: Real-time analytics, machine learning, graph processing.
    - **Hadoop MapReduce**: Batch processing of large datasets.

## Use Ccases:
1. **Streaming ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**:
    
    - Spark can process real-time data streams efficiently. It’s commonly used for ingesting, transforming, and loading data from various sources (e.g., logs, sensors, social media) into a data warehouse or analytics platform.
2. **Data Enrichment**:
    
    - Spark helps enhance raw data by combining it with additional information from external sources. For example, enriching customer profiles with geolocation data or historical behavior patterns.
3. **Trigger Event Detection**:
    
    - Spark enables real-time event detection and alerting. It’s useful for monitoring system logs, fraud detection, or identifying anomalies in financial transactions.
4. **Complex Session Analysis**:
    
    - Analyzing user sessions (e.g., web sessions, app interactions) to understand behavior patterns, session duration, and engagement metrics. Spark’s ability to handle large-scale data makes it ideal for this purpose.
5. **Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling**:
    
    - Spark’s MLlib library provides tools for building machine learning models. Use cases include recommendation systems, fraud detection, churn prediction, and natural language processing.
6. **Graph Processing**:
    
    - Spark’s GraphX library allows efficient graph computations. It’s valuable for social network analysis, recommendation engines, and network optimization.
7. **Batch Processing and Analytics**:
    
    - Spark can handle large-scale batch processing tasks, such as aggregating data, generating reports, and running complex SQL queries.

## Architecture:
- Spark apps run as independent sets of processes on a cluster.
- These sets are coordinated by SparkContext in the driver program.
- SparkContext connects to several types of cluster managers (e.g Mesos or YARN) which allocates resources across apps.
- Spark acquires nodes in the cluster.
- Nodes run processes of computations and store data.
- Next spark sends app code passed to the SpackContext to these nodes.
- Finally, SparkContext sends tasks to the nodes to run.
### Core Components:
- **Spark Core**:
	- handles all basic I/O functionalities.
	- Schedules and monitors jobs on the clusters.
	- Also is accountable for the ff:
		- networking with different storage systems
		- fault recovery
		- efficient memory
	- Unlike Hadoop, spark prevents shared data from bring persisted  in immediate stores. It uses resilient distributed datasets (RDD) to ensure this.
	- **RDDs**:
		- They are immutable 
		- When a large amount of data is to be processed it is broken down into chunks to be operated on in parallel. Those chunks are the RDDs.
		- They allow fault-tolerant in-memory computations.
		- Two ops can be performed on RDDs:
		- **Transformation**:
			- Transformations are operations that create a new RDD from an existing one.
			- They are lazy in nature, meaning they don’t execute immediately but build an RDD lineage (a directed acyclic graph of parent RDDs).
			- RDDs are immutable, so each transformation produces a fresh RDD.
			- Transformations are essential for building complex data processing pipelines.
			- **Types**
				- **Narrow Transformation**
					- Operates with a single partition of a single RDD
				- **Wide Transformation:**
					- Involves multiple partitions of a parent RDD.
				- **Examples:**
					- map()
					- filter()
					- flatMap()
					- union()
					- distinct()
		- **Actions:**
			- They are operations that return a value to the driver program
			- They trigger the execution of transformations and materialize the results.
			- Actions are the points where actual computation occurs.
			- Actions return non-RDD values
			- **Examples:**
				- count()
				- collect()
				- first()
				- reduce()
				- saveAsTextFile()
- **Spark SQL:**
	- For structured data processing.
	- For executing SQL queries.
	- It works with dataframes (i.e distributed collection of data ordered into columns)
	- Supports fetching data from different sources.
- **Spark Streaming:**
	- Enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of lice data streams. Data can be ingested from a number of sources, such as Kafka, FLume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets.
	- It can push processed data into file systems, databases and live dashboards.
- **Spark MLlib:**
- It's a machine learning library
- Provides tools such as:
  - Common ml algos such as; classification, regression, and clustering
  - Feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection
  - Tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML pipelines
  - Saving and loading algos, models, and pipelines
- **Spark GraphX**
- Meant for graphs and graph parallel-computations
