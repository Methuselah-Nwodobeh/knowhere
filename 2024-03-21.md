**Briquettes** can indeed be made more **water-resistant**, which is essential for their usability and storage. Here’s how Metjo can achieve this:

1. **Choice of Materials**:
    
    - **Binder Selection**: Use binders that are less water-soluble. Common binders include starch, clay, or molasses.
    - **Water-Resistant Additives**: Incorporate additives like paraffin wax or waterproofing agents during briquette production.
2. **Drying Process**:
    
    - **Thorough Drying**: Ensure briquettes are completely dry before packaging. Moisture weakens their structure and makes them susceptible to water damage.
    - **Sun-Drying**: Dry briquettes in direct sunlight for several days. Properly dried briquettes are less likely to absorb water.
3. **Packaging and Storage**:
    
    - **Waterproof Packaging**: Use moisture-resistant packaging materials (e.g., plastic bags or containers).
    - **Sealing**: Seal the packaging tightly to prevent water infiltration.
4. **Surface Treatment**:
    
    - **Water-Repellent Coating**: Apply a water-repellent coating to the surface of briquettes. This can be done using waterproof paints or sealants.
    - **Paraffin Wax Dip**: Dip briquettes in melted paraffin wax to create a protective layer.
5. **Testing and Quality Control**:
    
    - **Water Immersion Test**: Submerge briquettes in water for a specific duration (e.g., 24 hours) and assess their integrity afterward.
    - **Quality Assurance**: Regularly test a sample of briquettes to ensure they remain water-resistant.

Remember, achieving water resistance involves a combination of material selection, production techniques, and proper storage.
