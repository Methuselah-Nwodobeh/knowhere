# Micro services Architecture:

## **User Authentication Service:**  ON D
   - Responsible for user registration, login, and managing user profiles.
   - Provides authentication tokens for secure communication with other services.

## Alert Triggering Service (Mobile):
   - Handles the different methods of triggering emergency alerts (power button, gestures, etc.).
   - Validates and forwards alerts to the Alert Processing Service.

## **Alert Processing Service:**  ON D
   - Receives alerts from the Alert Triggering Service.
   - Associates alerts with users and sends confirmations.
   - Forwards alerts to the appropriate Emergency Contacts Service and Emergency Services Integration Service.

## **Emergency Contacts Service:**  ON D
   - Manages the user's emergency contacts and their notification preferences.
   - Sends notifications to emergency contacts using various communication channels.

## **Emergency Services Integration Service:**  ON D
   - Interfaces with emergency services (police, ambulance, etc.).
   - Provides location information and other details to assist in the response.

## **Location Tracking Service:**  ON D
   - Tracks users' real-time locations in the background.
   - Provides location data to the Alert Processing Service and Emergency Services Integration Service.

## **Response Tracking and Escalation Service:** ON D
   - Monitors responses from emergency contacts and services.
   - Handles escalation to higher levels of assistance if needed.

## **History and Reporting Service:** ON D
   - Stores the history of past alerts triggered by each user.
   - Generates reports for analysis and reporting purposes.

## **Notifications Service:**  ON D
   - Manages the sending of push notifications and other alerts to users and emergency contacts.

## **Security and Compliance Service:** ON D
-  Enforces data encryption and ensures compliance with relevant regulations.
	Provides a secure communication layer for all services.

## **Configuration and Settings Service:**  ON D
- Manages configuration settings for the app, including user preferences and system-wide parameters.

## **Notification Gateway Service:**  TBD
- Handles the communication with external notification gateways (SMS, push notification providers, etc.).

## **Dashboard and Reporting Service:** TBD
- Provides emergency services with a dashboard to manage ongoing alerts and resources.

## **Shared Utilities Service:**  TBD
* Contains common utilities, functions, and libraries used across different microservices.

Remember that the above division is just one way to structure the microservices. The actual design might vary based on your specific application requirements and technological considerations. Each micro-service should have its own distinct responsibility and communicate with others via well-defined APIs. Additionally, implementing a microservices architecture requires careful consideration of deployment, communication, security, and monitoring strategies.
